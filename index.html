    <h1>Basic HTML Tags Assignment</h1>

    <hr />

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>This assignment is to show my understanding and comprehension of the use of different HTML tags. I must show different tags, such as header and paragraphs, lists, tags with hyperlinks and finally images.</p>

    <p>I can even show off some skills that I have learned as well, like inserting lorem ipsum text through html. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aspernatur deleniti laboriosam soluta error illum fuga accusantium consectetur. Repellendus illum quis officia at, error unde quia voluptates asperiores numquam est accusamus! See that! I did that through knowing the specific tags in order to insert this text. Amazing!</p>
