    <hr />

    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>This assignment is to show my understanding and comprehension of the use of different HTML tags. I must show different tags, such as header and paragraphs, lists, tags with hyperlinks and finally images.</p>

    <p>I can even show off some other skills that I have learned as well, like inserting lorem ipsum text through html. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Aspernatur deleniti laboriosam soluta error illum fuga accusantium consectetur. Repellendus illum quis officia at, error unde quia voluptates asperiores numquam est accusamus! See that! I did that through knowing the specific tags in order to insert this text. Amazing!</p>

    <p>Finally, this overview has shown skills at both making a header tag, as well as a paragraph tag.</p>

    <h3>Lists</h3>

    <h5>Unordered List</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>This is an example of an unordered list</li>
        <li>It puts things in a list for you</li>
        <li>But it is just bulletpointed</li>
        <li>There is no real order, hence the name.</li>
    </ul>

    <h5>Ordered List</h5>
    <ol>
        <li>Ordered list will be numbered in sequence to how many line items you add.</li>
        <li>The more lines, the more numbers.</li>
        <li>At this point I'm just trying to fill space to make more lines.</li>
        <li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet. Lorem ipsum is always helpful with that.</li>
    </ol>
